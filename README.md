Chardon (formerly SellIt): Donate & Help

**Chardon** is a **React Native application under development** aiming to bridge the gap between **donors and those in need**, particularly individuals who lack access to technology. Originally known as "SellIt," the app has evolved from a platform for selling used items into a dedicated **donation app** designed to facilitate:

* **Listing donations:** Users can easily create listings specifying items like clothes, bags, furniture, etc., including quantity, description, and location.
* **Fundraising campaigns:** Organizations and NGOs can launch fundraisers for specific causes, allowing direct monetary donations from users.
* **Connecting donors and beneficiaries:** Firms and NGOs act as mediators, collecting donated items and distributing them to those who need them most.

**Key features:**

* **Intuitive interface:** User-friendly design for both listing donations and browsing available items or fundraisers.
* **Map integration:** Location visualization simplifies donation pickup arrangements.
* **Multiple user roles:** Separate functionalities for individual donors and organizational representatives.
* **Secure transactions:** Focus on trust and transparency in the donation process.

**Current status:**

Chardon is actively under development, and we welcome your feedback and suggestions! Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute/suggest through the GitHub issues tab.


**Together, let's build a platform that empowers communities through thoughtful donations.**
